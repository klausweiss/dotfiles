# Welcome to Koka

<img style="float: right; width:12em" src="images/koka-logo-filled.svg">

Koka is a strongly typed functional-style language with effect types and handlers --
generating direct C code without needing a runtime system. To learn more:

* Read the [Koka book][kokabook] for a tour of the Koka language and its specification.
* View the Koka __Samples__ in VS Code by opening the command panel (`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`),
  and running the `Koka: Open samples` command.  
  (when you start typing the command will surface to the top).

### v3.1.1

### v3.1.0, 2024-02-14

- Language Server now supports the stdio protocol via the `--language-server --lsstdio` combination of flags.

- Building is now highly concurrent with much faster build times.

- Internal redesign of (named) effect generation to match the formal systems more closely. See `samples/handlers/named` for examples. 

- Clarified evidence vector API, and various other improvements and bug fixes.

### v3.0.4, 2024-01-25

- Improved VS Code integration with better hover and inlay information. 

- Revised `std/core` which is now split in separate modules.

- Fixed infinite expansion bug in the implicit parameter resolver, and various other small bug fixes.

### v3.0.1, 2024-01-13:

<img style="float:right; height:18em; border:1px solid gray; margin:1ex" src="images/impliciteq.png"> 

- Introducing __locally qualified names__ to always be able to refer to (overloaded) identifiers explicitly.
  See the `samples/basic/qualifiers` example for more information. (use the `Koka: Open samples` command to open the samples directory).

- __Implicit parameters__ are a new experimental feature that allow parameterized overloading of equality, show, etc.
  See the `samples/basic/implicits` example for more information.

- Many improvements to the VS Code integration. Press and hold `ctrl+alt` (or `ctrl+option` on
  MacOS) to show __inlay hints__ -- showing inferred types, fully qualified names, and implicit arguments.

### v2.6.0, 2023-12-30:

- Using the new __first-class constructor contexts__ to improve efficiency of various `std/core` functions
  like `partition`. See the `samples/syntax/contexts.kk` example for an overview, and 
  the accompanying [paper][fccontext] for an in-depth discussion.

- Using further __fully in-place__ `fip` and `fbip` annotations for various `std/core` functions.
  See the `samples/syntax/fip.kk` example for an overview and the [paper][fip] for a more technical overview.

- Initial VS Code language support with type information, jump to definition,
  run test functions directly from the editor, automatic Koka installation, and many more things.
  Special thanks to [Tim Whiting](https://github.com/TimWhiting) and [Fredrik Wieczerkowski](https://github.com/fwcd) for all their work on making this possible!

- The ability to run `main`, `test...`, and `example...` functions directly from
  the editor by clicking on the `run debug | optimized` code lenses.

  <img style="width:15em; border:1px solid grey" src="images/codelens.png">

- The VS Code extension prompts to automatically install the latest Koka compiler.

- Various bug fixes and extended bit-level operations on `int32`/`int64`.

Enjoy!

## Previous Releases

* `v2.4.2`, 2023-07-03: interim release with support for the new `fip` and `fbip` keywords
  to support fully-in-place programming. Various bug fixes and performance
  enhancements.
* `v2.4.0`, 2022-02-07: automatic generation of installation packages for various Linux
  distributions (by [Rubikscraft](https://github.com/rubikscraft)), improved specialization and integer add/sub, add `rbtree-fbip` sample,
  improve grammar (`pub` (instead of `public`, remove private (as it is always default)),
  `final ctl` (instead of `brk`), underscores in number literals, etc),
  rename `double` to `float64`, various bug fixes.
* `v2.3.8`, 2021-12-27: improved `int` performance, various bug fixes, update wasm backend,
  initial conan support, fix js backend.
* `v2.3.6`, 2021-11-26: fix specialization bug, add `std/os/readline` module.
* `v2.3.4`, 2021-11-26: `maybe`-like types are already value types, but now also no longer need heap allocation
  if not nested (and `[Just(1)]` uses the same heap space as `[1]`),
  improved atomic refcounting (by Anton Lorenzen), improved specialization (by Steven Fontanella),
  various small fixes, fix build on freeBSD.
* `v2.3.2`, 2021-10-15: initial wasm support (use `--target=wasm`, and install [emscripten] and [wasmtime]),
  improved reuse specialization (by Anton Lorenzen),
  fix default color scheme for non-dark shells (#190), stack-less free and marking, add `--stack` option,
  [musl] support (use `--cc=musl-gcc`), fix `vcpkg` support on macOS with homebrew installed vcpkg, various bug fixes.
* `v2.3.1`, 2021-09-29: improved TRMC optimizations, and improved reuse

  function expressions (e.g. `xs.map( fn(x) x + 1 )`) and operation clauses. Allow `ctl` for `control`.
