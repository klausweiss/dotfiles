- Remove all EVENT firing from lib/git/* - this should be in the action
- Remove all IO from lib/git/* - these should all be (nearly) pure functions that take IO as arguments
  - IO (user input, etc) belongs in the actions functions
  - Find a nicer way to mock/stub the CLI in tests so we can just assert on strings instead of requiring git stuff/state

- The actions are our imperative shell - the lib is the functional core

- Pass git dir for all CLI commands to be used with `-C ...` flag to better handle CWD stuff?
