The general UI/UX principle this plugin follows is to make using flutter *easy* in neovim. The flutter binary provides a treasure trove of
functionality and rather than trying to replace it or do arcane things. This plugin doesn't aim to compete directly with Android Studio or Xcode
it shouldn't be geared towards duplicating those plugins feature sets but can take inspiration where practical.

Ultimately the flutter teams approach to the flutter binary is that it generally exposes all the features developers needs so this plugin primarily just
surfaces this in a nice and easy to use way, tying commands together where it makes sense and populating arguments based on user input.

## Architecture/layout
This plugin essentially uses a single file for most features or areas of functionality it provides. Where a feature gets large and has sub features that can be turned into a folder.
